# Prime Counting

The prime counting function π(x) represents the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer x.

This repository focuses on implementing various simple prime counting methods, including the Trial Method, Modified Trial Method, Sieve Method, and Sieve Method with Partition based on length. These methods provide foundational understanding and serve as precursors to more advanced techniques such as the [Meissel-Lehmer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissel%E2%80%93Lehmer_algorithm).

## Background

The study of prime numbers dates back to ancient times, with significant contributions from mathematicians like Euclid, Euler, and others. Here are some resources we used to understand the background concepts:

- [Infinitely Many Primes | Brilliant Math & Science Wiki](https://brilliant.org/wiki/infinitely-many-primes/)
- [Distribution of Primes | Brilliant Math & Science Wiki](https://brilliant.org/wiki/distribution-of-primes/)
- [Primality Testing | Brilliant Math & Science Wiki](https://brilliant.org/wiki/prime-testing/)

The quest to understand the distribution of primes and develop efficient primality tests has led to the exploration of various algorithms and methods.

## Why Prime Numbers are Important?

Prime numbers are not only of theoretical interest but also hold practical significance in various fields:

- **Cryptography:** Prime numbers are crucial in cryptography, forming the basis for many cryptographic algorithms. They are used in generating secure keys for encryption and decryption processes.
- **Computational Number Theory:** Prime numbers are central to computational number theory, a field with applications in cryptography, computer science, and information theory. Understanding the properties of prime numbers helps in developing efficient algorithms for various computational tasks.
- **Information Science:** Prime numbers play a fundamental role in information science, particularly in data compression and error correction algorithms. They are used in encoding and decoding messages efficiently.
- **Computer Science:** Prime numbers are utilized in various algorithms and data structures in computer science. For example, hashing functions often use prime numbers to distribute keys uniformly across a hash table, reducing collisions.

Understanding prime numbers and their properties is essential for advancing research and innovation in these and many other fields.

## Prime Counting Methods Explored

### Trial Method

The Trial Method involves iterating from 2 to N-1 and checking divisibility. Although straightforward, its time complexity is O(N^2), but this can be optimized to O(√N) by looping from 2 to √N.

### Modified Trial Method

This method improves upon the Trial Method by looping only through prime numbers up to √N, enhancing performance at the cost of increased memory usage.

### Sieve Method

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm that efficiently identifies prime numbers up to a given integer by sieving out composites.

### Sieve Method with Partition

An enhanced version of the Sieve Method, it incorporates partitioning based on length for improved memory management.

## Getting Started
